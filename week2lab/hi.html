                My name is Adam Mirza. I am 22 years old now and I am based in Nilai. I didn't know what to say about myself but I will
                give it a go.
                <br> <br>
                I am not a talkative person in large gathering and prefer to do things alone but I can become talkative if in a small
                group of conversation. I like to learn new things especially if it's related to tech. During my free time I like to watch
                movies and anime or F1 even though my friends said F1 is boring.
